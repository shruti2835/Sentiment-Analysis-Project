This project focusess on analysis Covid-19 Tweets and predicting the sentiments of the Tweets.
The dataset for this project has been taken from Kaggle. The use of different NLP techniques such as stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal has been demonstrated in this project. The training dataset consists of 41157 tweets and the testing dataset consists of 3798 tweets. In the original datasets there are 5 sentiments in the sentiment column namely positive, extremely positive, negative, extremely negative and neutral. In this project I have used 3 class classification for faster and easier analysis. 
The use of different models and neural networks such as RNN, Bi-LSTM's and GRUs is also demonstrated.
